** Algorithm for filtering data of latitidue and longitude values. **

Theres a results.pdf which shows some results and some explaination of the algorithm.

Input file is placed in the Data folder.
An output file is created called output.csv. 
Graphs.xlsx uses values from the input and output csv to display the filtered data.
Images contain some images of the graphs excel sheet after running the program.

Most configurable values are in the Constants.h file.
There are some extra calculations done like the total deviation between each value which could be used inplace
of the seperate x,y calculations but that gave different results.

Some unit tests have been added but these are pretty basic tests.
